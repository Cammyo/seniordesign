A cybersecurity game utilizing LLM

## Introduction
Develop an educational and interactive cybersecurity simulation game where you play as an attacker hacking a fake organization that an LLM generates for you. This will give the player hands on cybersecurity experience in a narrative driven environment. 

## Project Scope
- Game Flow: Using a Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG to provide an outline for stories to move through.
- OpenAI API or potentially a custom homebrew LLM solution for generating narrative responses.
- Minigames for in depth specific learning on advanced MITRE techniques.
- A master LLM which will control the flow of the game, with a secondary story and minigame LLM to control individual narratives and custom technique specific prompts.
- UI/UX potentially a small webapp so it can be easily hosted and played in a browser.
  
## Technologies
- Python
- Networkx for generating graphs
- OpenAI API for easily getting started with LLM prompts
- Javascript/Typescript for any potential frontend required

## Methodology
### 1. Game Flow:
### 2. LLM Integration:
### 3. Implementation:
### 4. Testing and Iteration:

## Expected Outcomes
- An engaging experience with an immersive story driven cyberattack simulation
- Demonstrate key phases and techniques from the MITRE attack framework
- Enhance and educate player understanding of offensive cybersecurity tactics
- Provide hands on experience allowing players to make decisions and witness realistic consequences for various actions
